/*
 * Problem: Find Student with Highest Average Marks (Optimized)
 *
 * Description:
 * Same as above â€” we are given a 2D array where each row is a student,
 * and each column represents a subject's mark. The goal is to find the
 * student with the highest average marks.
 *
 * Optimized Logic:
 * - Instead of storing all averages in an array, calculate each average on the fly.
 * - Track the highest average and corresponding student index while iterating.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n * m)  (same as brute-force)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)     (no extra array used)
